This is the data and code for our upcoming paper, "Cover-based allometric estimate of aboveground biomass of a non-native, invasive annual grass (*Bromus tectorum* L.) in the Great Basin, USA"

The main scripts are `R/a_data_prep.R` and `R/b_lm_figures.R`.

`R/ee_day_of_year_analysis.R` uses google earth engine data to get the peak NDVI dates. The raw data are too big for github, but are available upon request.

`R/precip_extract.R` extracts the precipitation data from PRISM. Also too big for github but available upon request. It is also easily downloaded from PRISM's website.
